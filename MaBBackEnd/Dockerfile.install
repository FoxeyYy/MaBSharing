# Install the dependencies by only copying now the package files and
# copying in the rest after we run npm install.

# This will save some time when building a image by taking better
# advantage of docker build’s layer caching.

# Install the dependencies and remove the downloaded files, they won't

# To deploy the application image to production, copy the application
